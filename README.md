# Detection-of-suspicious-activities-in-videos-using-machine-learning
📘 Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent surveillance system that can automatically detect suspicious or abnormal activities in video footage. The goal is to enhance safety and reduce the need for continuous manual monitoring.

⚙️ Methodology

Used OpenCV for video processing and frame analysis.

Applied MediaPipe for human pose estimation and movement tracking.

Analyzed body keypoints and motion patterns to identify unusual or suspicious activities, such as running, fighting, or loitering.

Tested the system on multiple video samples to ensure accurate real-time detection.

✨ Key Features

Real-time detection of human movements and actions.

Highlights suspicious activities in video frames.

Uses MediaPipe Pose for accurate tracking of body movements.

Can be integrated with CCTV or other surveillance systems.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

MediaPipe

NumPy

📊 Outcome

The system successfully detects abnormal or suspicious actions in videos with real-time performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining computer vision with pose estimation for security applications.
